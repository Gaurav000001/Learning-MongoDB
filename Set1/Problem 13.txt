**Problem 13:**

- **Prerequisite**: Understand filtering with multiple conditions in SQL / MongoDB
- **Problem**: Write a query to fetch all customers whose **`id`** is greater than 2 and **`name`** starts with 'B'.


NOTE: by default MongoDB takes multiple conditions with AND

db.Customers.find({
    _id: {$gt: 2},
    name: {$regex: /^B/i}
})
