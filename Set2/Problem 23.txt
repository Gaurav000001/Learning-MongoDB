**Problem 23:**

- **Prerequisite**: Understand how to use the AVG function in SQL / MongoDB's aggregate functions
- **Problem**: Write a query to calculate the average **`average_rating`** of all restaurants.



db.Restaurants.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      avgAverageRating: { $avg: "$average_rating" }
    }
  }
])

The $group stage groups all documents into a single group (using _id: null) to perform aggregation operations on the entire collection.
The $avg operator calculates the average of the average_rating field within the grouped documents.




db.Restaurants.aggregate([
  {
    $group: {
      _id: null,
      totalRatings: { $sum: "$average_rating" },
      count: { $sum: 1 }
    }
  },
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      avgAverageRating: { $divide: ["$totalRatings", "$count"] }
    }
  }
])

The first $group stage groups all documents into a single group (using _id: null) and calculates the total sum of average_rating values (totalRatings) and counts the number of documents (count).
The $project stage then calculates the average by dividing the totalRatings by the count.
